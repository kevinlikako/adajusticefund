    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>The <strong>ADA Justice Fund</strong> is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocating for digital accessibility and ensuring equal online access for individuals with disabilities. Since our founding in 2009, we have worked with thousands of businesses, advocacy groups, and individuals to make the digital world more inclusive.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe that <strong>access to digital services is a fundamental right</strong>. Our mission is to:</p>

        <li>Promote the adoption of inclusive web technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Digital Accessibility Matters</h2>
    <p>Over <strong>61 million Americans</strong> live with a disability, yet many websites, apps, and digital platforms fail to provide equal access. This results in discrimination and exclusion from essential services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Online banking, shopping, and e-commerce.</li>
        <li>Medical portals and telehealth services.</li>
        <li>Government and legal resources.</li>
        <li>Employment and educational opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We work tirelessly to <strong>bridge this gap</strong> and make the internet a space where everyone can participate equally.</p>
